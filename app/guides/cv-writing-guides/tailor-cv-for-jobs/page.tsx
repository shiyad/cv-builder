          1. Review the Job Description Carefully
        </h2>
        <p>
          Before you begin tailoring your CV, read the job description
          thoroughly. Pay attention to the following:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mt-2">
          <li>Required skills and qualifications</li>
          <li>Key responsibilities and tasks</li>
          <li>Desired experience and achievements</li>
          <li>Company values and culture</li>
        </ul>

        <p className="mt-4">
          Use the job description to identify the keywords and phrases that
          employers are looking for. These can include specific skills,
          certifications, or job-related terms. Incorporating these keywords
          will help you optimize your CV for ATS.

          2. Adjust Your Professional Summary
        </h2>
        <p>
          Your professional summary should highlight your most relevant skills
          and achievements in line with the specific role. If you're applying
          for a marketing job, focus on your marketing skills; if it's a tech
          role, emphasize your technical expertise.

            "Experienced project manager with a proven track record of leading

        </div>

        <p>
          You don’t need to completely rewrite your summary for every job, but
          make sure it’s tailored to the specific job description and reflects
          your most relevant skills and experience.

          3. Highlight Relevant Work Experience
        </h2>
        <p>
          Under your work experience section, only include positions, skills,
          and achievements that are most relevant to the job you're applying
          for. Don’t list everything. Focus on the experiences that show how
          you’re a good fit for the position.
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mt-2">
          <li>
            Match your previous job titles with those mentioned in the job
            description (without exaggerating)

          <li>
            Show how your accomplishments directly tie to the responsibilities
            listed in the job ad
          </li>
          <li>Use bullet points to highlight achievements, not just duties</li>

          4. Tailor Your Skills Section
        </h2>
        <p>
          Your skills section should showcase the skills that align with the job
          requirements. Make sure to differentiate between technical skills
          (such as programming languages or software tools) and soft skills
          (like communication or leadership).
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mt-2">
          <li>
            <strong>For Technical Roles:</strong> Emphasize specific tools and
            technologies (e.g., Python, SQL, JavaScript)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>For Creative Roles:</strong> Highlight design tools (e.g.,
            Adobe Photoshop, Sketch, Figma)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>For Management Roles:</strong> Showcase leadership,
            communication, and project management skills
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-4">
          By aligning your skills with the job posting, you'll not only appeal
          to the recruiter, but also increase the chance of passing ATS scans.

          5. Don’t Forget Keywords
        </h2>
        <p>
          Applicant Tracking Systems use keywords to filter CVs. Make sure you
          include important terms from the job description in your CV. This
          includes:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mt-2">
          <li>Job titles (e.g., Marketing Manager, Software Developer)</li>
          <li>
            Skills and certifications (e.g., Project Management, AWS Certified)
          </li>
          <li>Industry-specific terms (e.g., SaaS, Agile, B2B)</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-4">
          Be natural when incorporating keywords—avoid keyword stuffing. Use
          them where they fit contextually to ensure your CV remains readable
          for both ATS and humans.

          6. Proofread and Format
        </h2>
        <p>
          After tailoring your CV, take the time to proofread for spelling,
          grammar, and formatting errors. A polished CV creates a better
          impression and shows attention to detail.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mt-2">
          <li>Ensure consistent formatting (font, spacing, alignment)</li>
          <li>
            Remove any unnecessary information (e.g., hobbies or outdated
            skills)
          </li>
          <li>Save your CV as a PDF to preserve formatting</li>

          Final Thoughts
        </h2>
        <p>
          Tailoring your CV takes time, but it’s essential to increase your
          chances of landing an interview. Every job you apply for is different,
          and your CV should reflect that by showcasing your most relevant
          skills and experiences.
