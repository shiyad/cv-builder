          1. Understand the Power of Networking
        </h2>
        <p>
          Many job opportunities are never advertised—they're shared via word of
          mouth. Building a strong professional network can help you access
          these hidden opportunities, gain insider insights, and stay
          top-of-mind when roles open up.
        </p>
        <p>
          Think of networking as investing in your future. Every connection you
          make can potentially lead to mentorship, collaboration, or even job
          offers down the line.

          2. Start with Your Existing Network
        </h2>
        <p>
          You already know more people than you think. Start by reaching out to
          classmates, former coworkers, professors, or people you’ve
          collaborated with in the past. Let them know what you're working on or
          looking for—they may be able to help or connect you with someone who
          can.

          3. Be Strategic with Events and Communities
        </h2>
        <p>
          Attend events that align with your industry or career goals. These can
          be professional conferences, local meetups, webinars, or virtual
          roundtables. Engage with others by asking thoughtful questions and
          following up with new contacts after the event.

          4. Use LinkedIn to Your Advantage
        </h2>
        <p>
          LinkedIn is one of the most powerful networking tools available. Keep
          your profile up to date, post insights relevant to your field, and
          engage with content from others. Use the platform to initiate
          conversations with people in your industry—even those you haven’t met
          yet.

          5. Keep It Authentic and Consistent
        </h2>
        <p>
          The best professional relationships are built on authenticity. Don’t
          try to impress—focus on connecting. And remember, networking is a long
          game. Keep nurturing your relationships over time by checking in,
          offering help, and staying in touch.
