          1. Define Your Unique Strengths and Values
        </h2>
        <p>
          The first step in building your professional brand is identifying what
          sets you apart from others in your field. Reflect on your strengths,
          skills, and values that align with your career aspirations. Ask
          yourself:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mt-4">
          <li>What do I do better than others?</li>
          <li>What core values guide my work ethic?</li>
          <li>What unique experiences and skills do I have to offer?</li>
        </ul>

        <p className="mt-6">
          Once you've defined these core elements, they will form the foundation
          of your personal brand. Be consistent in showcasing these strengths
          across all your professional platforms.
